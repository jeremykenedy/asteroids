Credits

I got the inspiration for this project from Haseeb Qureshi's implementation of Asteroids. You can play his game here: http://haseeb-qureshi.github.io/Asteroids/

For some of the code inside Game.Vue, I followed an Asteroids tutorial using Phaser.io. You can find the tutorial I used here: http://www.zekechan.net/asteroids-html5-game-tutorial-1/
